      <span>Title:</span> Rape; Justifiable?

      <span>Bible Passage:</span>  
      Genesis 34:1-2 (NLT)
      One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area.
        But when the local prince, Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, saw Dinah, he seized her and raped her.

    <div class="content"> 
      <span>Message:</span>
      Dinah was the 11th child of Jacob, the 7th child of Leah, and the only daughter Jacob had.
      <br>
      Why did she go visiting?
      Maybe she was bored and lonely as being the only female since the boys mostly/possibly spent time together.
      <br>
      Why did Shechem choose to rape her?
      <br>
      As a Prince, was it okay to do anything to anyone? Even to rape?
      <br>
      Did he rape her because he was above the law or because there was no law against such act?
      <br>
      Did he consider the emotional trauma she would go through after the rape?
      <br>
      Was he concerned about the stigma, pain, shame, etc that awaited her after such an awful act?
      <br>
      If he knew how the story would end, could he have aborted that thought of rape?
      <br>
      Sighâ€¦
      <br>
      If Shechem never set his eyes on Dinah, and if he had decided to do right even after seeing her, the terrible occurrence wouldn't have happened.
      <br>
      May we not go to places that will damage our destinies, may we not cross paths with those who are capable of wrecking our lives, and may their plans/thoughts towards us be abolished/thwarted in Jesus' name. Amen
      <br>
      As many who are suffering for the evil actions of others, even rape, may the Holy Spirit heal and comfort you. May He make you victorious over the pains and the negativities surrounding the situation in Jesus' name. Amen
      <br>
      To those who specialise in hurting others as Shechem did, let's REPENT from our wicked & evil ways, return to God, and He will forgive us. Isaiah 55:7
      NOTE: We will all reap what we sow; either good or evil. Galatians 6:7-8
